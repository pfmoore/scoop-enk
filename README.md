# Enk Bucket

A [scoop](https://scoop.sh/) bucket containing various programs I
find useful which I haven't found packaged for scoop anywhere else.

[Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) is a windows package manager similar to
apt-get or homebrew. You can add this bucket to scoop using

```
scoop bucket add enk https://github.com/pfmoore/scoop-enk
```
